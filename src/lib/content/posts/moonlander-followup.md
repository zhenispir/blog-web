This post is a follow-up to the previous post, [Impressions of the ZSA Moonlander at one month](/blog/moonlander). If you would rather just get the Cliff's notes version of that post, however:

- I wasn't really interested in mechanical keyboards in general (and especially not the Moonlander in particular), but ergonomics and a repetitive stress injury forced my hand.
- Using an ortholinear layout is super difficult to get used to
